		<h1>Raihan Kheraj</h1>
		<p>People describe me as a <strong>social</strong>, diligent person who excels in working with others. In high school, I moved around quite a bit due to playing for different prep <em>hockey</em> school teams. I was lucky enough to continue playing <em>hockey</em> at the Junior A level.</p>
        <p>Adapting to new schools and environments was a major challenge, but it not only allowed me to mature as an individual, but also make meaningful connections with people from various cultures and backgrounds.</p>
